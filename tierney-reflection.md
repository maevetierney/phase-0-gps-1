#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was really confused about when you need to switch your branches and when you need to create them. In the beginning of the exercise, Ryan and I asked our instructor, Bison, for help and he clarified with us that later in the exercise we would need to begin creating new branches. 

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The branches concept, merging and merge conflicts: how to stop them and how to create them. 

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
-Things about branches
-Things about merging 
-Git enit: installing it on your computer

#What still confuses you about git?
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
The proper workflow for git changes: is add before commit or do you commit before you add? Pushing still kind of confuses me as well. 

#How was your experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was not as scary as I thought it would be! Bison helped a lot.
